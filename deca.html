        <p>Deca Clark Wakeboard is a cable wakeboard park situated in Margot, Angeles City, which is behind the perimeter wall of Clark Freeport zone in Pampanga. Opened in December 2012, this action-packed leisure spot is especially designed for both trained and aspiring wakeboard riders. The park features a full-size 5-point Rixen main cable that will pull you across the lake at a constant speed. The main lake has five corners with obstacles like an A-frame, curved kicker, and wedge, in between. Meanwhile, first-time or less experienced wakeboards can learn and practice the basics in the separate Easy Start Beginners' Area. </p>

        <h2>Best time to visit</h2>
        <br>
        <p>It is best to book a session here in the dry months of December to May as there are fewer chances of tropical rainstorms during this time. However, visitors may still go wakeboarding in light to moderate rain. Lifestyle and aspiring riders can also spend their wakeboarding holidays or trainings in this park as it is open every day from 8 AM to 6 PM. </p>
