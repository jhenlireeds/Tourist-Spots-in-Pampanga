        <h2>How to get there </h2>
        <p>DINOSAURS ISLAND is located in Clark Freeport Zone, Pampanga.  Clark is located 80 kilometers north of Manila and is reachable by land or air.  Driving by car from Manila takes an hour and a half.  Take the North Luzon Expressway and exit at Dau, Mabalacat, Pampanga.  Make a left turn toward Angeles City and then a right turn toward Clark.
            <br>
            <br>
            Clark may also be reached via the new Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX). From the North Luzon Expressway, continue the drive leading to the SCTEX exit.  You may use either the Clark North Interchange (Panday Pira access road near Nayong Pilipino) or Clark South Interchange (near Yokohama and Clark Main Gate) to enter Clark. From Clark, via the newly-opened Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway, you can reach Subic within a 30-minute drive and the Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac in 15 minutes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Public buses also ply the routes on a daily basis.  Ride a Victory Liner bound for Dagupan and alight at Dau common terminal.  Walk a bit toward the highway where jeepneys or tricycles are available.  These vehicles can take you right up the Clark gate.  Another bus line, Philippine Rabbit, also has trips to Angeles, Pampanga, via Dau, and other buses going north may also pass by the area.  Ask the driver or conductor beforehand to be sure.</p>
