        <p>Mt. Pinatubo is no longer the terror that it was more than two decades ago. It is now a prime tourist destination which offers various kinds of adventures for those gutsy enough to go through it. You could trek through Pinatubo’s Crow Valley Canyon, view its crater through a chartered light aircraft, visit the Tayawan Caldera, and even get a Pinatubo spa using lahar sediments left by the eruption.</p>

        <h2>How to Go to Mt. Pinatubo from Manila </h2>
        <p>The scenic Mt. Pinatubo, all 4,757 feet of it, is nestled between Zambales and Pampanga, making this destination ideal for weekend adventures like hiking near Manila. Below are several ways to reach its jumpoff point in Capas, Tarlac, which is only a few hours away from the Philippine capital. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Public Transportation</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Hop on a bus going to Capas, Tarlac via any major bus terminal in Manila, Cubao, or Pasay. It just depends on which is closest to where you are staying. You also have the option to ride buses with routes going to Baguio, Ilocos, or Pangasinan and tell the conductor you’re getting off at Sta. Juliana in Capas.
            <br>
            <br>
        Once there, you can choose to ride a tricycle or a jeepney as long as it’s going to Sta. Juliana Tourism. There you will have to pay necessary environmental fees, and then they will assist you in booking your 4x4 tours in the Philippines that will take you closer to the mountain.</p>
