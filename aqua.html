        <p>Aqua Planet is known to be the biggest water park in the Philippines which is located at Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone in the province of Pampanga. It offers tourists a swimming ride, outdoor food court, stalls, a commemorative shop, elegant shower rooms, grand facilities, and water attractions for every age. Inside the water park, there is a separate waterslide and wave pool which tourists can choose from.
            <br>
            <br> 
            Aqua Planet has a total of thirty-eight slides and attractions which are surrounded by lush vegetation. It is believed to be the most modern water park in the Philippines. It is only fifty minutes away from Subic Bay via Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX) and fifteen minutes away from Clark International Airport and SM City Clark. In addition, it is only a two hours and thirty minutes drive from Metro Manila. Aqua Planet has a size of ten hectares or 100,000 square meters that can accommodate five thousand tourists daily.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The reason itâ€™s called Aqua Planet because it was originated from ancient Pampanga mythology. The story goes like this, once upon a time the affectionate water god name Halia and the courageous fire god name Pinatubo loved each other. As time goes by they were separated by the god of heaven named Zeus. Pinatubo was sent to the mortal world and for this reason, it turned him into a volcano. On the other hand, Halia beseeches Zeus to turn her into a charming water planet so she could be with Pinatubo. The god of heaven accepted her request and the water planet was named Halia Aqua Planet. Presently, people living in Angeles City Pampanga deeply think whenever it rains in their region, the attractive water god Halia misses the courageous fire god Pinatubo.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>According to its past history, Aqua Planet was established by Bb International Leisure And Resort Development Corporation which is a Filipino-Taiwanese business firm. The water park cost 2.5 billion pesos and it was planned by Taiwanese engineers and architects. The main attraction was designed by Aquatic Development Group for a brand new state-of-the-art water park in the Philippines with a large size wave pool.</p>
